# AERMOD_Framework
This framework is designed to help people who are doing many simulations to simply set
parameters to write the inputs, run, and process the outputs of AERMOD. 

OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows (versions of AERPLOT and AERMOD needed for other OS)

PYTHON VERSION: Python 3.x

DEPENDENCIES: openpyxl

The requirements to run this framework is that you need to have meteorological data
already processed by AERMET. Once you have processed AERMET data, this framework is
fully ready to be used. AERMAP isn't required to run this framework, but the program
can accept AERMAP data and use it in AERMOD runs if specified.

run_framework.py contains in depth detail about the parameters used to run the framework,
and should be used as a reference for how the framework works and for more information
about the outputs
