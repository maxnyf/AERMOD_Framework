This is an example of the framework working with meteorological data from the
denver international airport. The coordinates for aerplot also plot to the 
denver international airport. The framework is currently set to a grid 
receptor system and to run aerplot to create a contour plot of the 
emission concentration data over the airport.

This code also contains an example of a script that randomly creates emittor
source coordinates and emission rates. There is more information at the top of the
'run_framework_den.py' on how to run the example code snippet, but to activate this 
code snippet, simply uncomment lines 3-8 and lines 209-235.

You will need to add the following files to the folder with the
run_framework_den.py file and the '.pfl' and '.sfc' files:
aermod.exe,
aerplot.exe,
mainframe.py,
output_processing_functions.py,
input_script_functions.py
